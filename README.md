20.copy the token string for later when we deploy the vercel backend, the token should look something like this:

```json
{"token": "jhgdfgdhgfh", "refresh_token": "1//sdhgbfdhghd", "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token", "client_id": "hsdgfjhgfsd.apps.googleusercontent.com", "client_secret": "gfsdfsdgf", "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"]}
```
21. goto vercel.com create a new project, click import third party repo.

### Installing the addon to your Stremio account:

1. Get the url of the vercel app you deployed. Add `/manifest.json` to the end. For example if my app url is `https://<your app url.vercel.app/' add `/manifest.json` to the end to get: `https://<your app url.vercel.app/manifest.json`. Copy this url.
2. Open stremio on desktop or android and go to addons section.
3. In the search bar paste the manifest link (`https://<your app url.vercel.app/manifest.json`) and press enter. Click install and you are done.

## How the addon works

The addon uses the drive api to search for video files in your drive (both your teamdrives and mydrive) kinda like using the google drive web search bar. 

So after setting up the addon go and search for something on stremio. When you open a search result, stremio will ask the addon if it has the video for the search result. The addon searches for the video in your google drive and if it gets any result it will give it to stremio and stremio will display the results. 

For example if I want to watch a movie, say its called **Pirates of the Goolag**, then:
* I will open stremio and search for **Pirates of the Goolag**. If its on imdb then it should appear on the stremio search results (stremio fetches search results from imdb).
* Open the search result for **Pirates of the Goolag** and stremio will ask the addon if it has a video stream for **Pirates of the Goolag**. 
* The addon searches in your Google Drive for **Pirates of the Goolag** and if its anywhere on your google drive, doesnt matter where as long as the video file has the _name_ and _year_ of the movie (for eg: **Pirates of the Goolag 2016.mkv** or **Pirates.of.the.Goolag.2016.UHD.BluRay.x265.mkv**), the addon will return the search results for **Pirates of the Goolag**. 
* Stremio will then display it as a video stream and all you have to do is tap on it and enjoy. 

The addon searches for:

* Movies by searching for Videos with their filename as the name of the movie and when it was released. 
  Eg video filename: **Pirates of the Goolag 2016.mkv**
* Series episodes by searching for Videos with their filename as the name of the series and which episode it was by a specifier. Supported specifiers are:

    * S01 E01
    * S1 E1
    * Season 1 Episode 1
    * 1x01
    * 1x1
